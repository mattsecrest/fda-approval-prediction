          <h1>Concept</h1>
			  <p>
			  Stock prices of pharmaceutical drug manufacturers depend on many factors.
			  The pipeline of drugs approved for the FDA is one major factor, particularly for small companies.
			  Consider the price of Karyopharm therapeutics below.
			  On July 3, 2019, Karyopharm's drug Selinexor was approved for use in patients with Multiple Myeloma, leading to a spike in stock price.

			  <p>
			  Investors attempt to predict drug approval in order to profit from lower drug prices for drugs that will eventually be approved.
			  This process is laborious: it requires knowledge of alternative therapies, the disease area, the FDA approval process, etc. 
			  </p>
			  
			  <b> What if there was a rhetorical question that could be answered by this website? What if the answer was a tool? This tool could estimate the probability of FDA approval for a medication based
			  solely on the abstract of the clinical trial results. This tool could help casual investors identify drugs with high likelihood of approval using minimal effort.
			  There is such a tool. This is the tool. </b>
			  </p>
		  <h1>How it works</h1>
			  <p>
			  Right now, it absolutely does not, but it will soon. The tool uses use natural language processing (NLP) to identify subleties in the clinical trial results 
			  abstract that may be predictive of FDA approval. Three data sources combine to create the training dataset:
			  </p>
			
			  <h5>ClinicalTrials.gov</h5>
			  <p>This data source was used to get data on all clinical trials of drugs or biologics which were initiated after 1990.</p>
			  <h5>FDA.gov</h5>
			  <p>This data source was used for data on FDA drug approvals. Two linkage methods (so far) have been used to link it to the clinical trials data source: unique drug name, and 'other' clinical trial name.
		  	  <h5>PubMed.com</h5>
			  <p>Abstracts of clinical trials since 1990 with an abstract published on PubMed were scraped to get text of results which may be predictive of FDA approval.
			  The cumulative number of abstracts in the database by publication date is below.</p>
